The first step of this course is designed to be taught HTML by using Notepad because students needd to know the tage and its attributes so that they can control the look and feel of their wed pages. By using Notepad as an editor to create web pages, students have to type all the HTML tags and its attributes to make them look more peofessional. This way can be ensured that all students can make some changes they need by going inside of the source code. This is important step for students to start before going to write PHP code.
